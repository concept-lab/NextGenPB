# NextGenPB 

Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann solver on Octree mesh.

Solves the linearized PBE 

\[
-\mathrm{div} \left( \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \nabla \varphi \right) + \kappa^2 \varphi = \rho^f
\]

on a rectangular domain.

## basic usage instructions

### Installation

The direct dependencies of the code are:

- **`bim++`**  
- **`NanoShaper`**  

For post-processing, you will also need:  

- **Paraview**  
- **GNU Octave**  

To compile the program, create a `local_settings.mk` file to add or modify the compilation options specified in the `Makefile`. Then, run:  


```bash
make
```

### command line options

To run the code in serial, using the default `options.pot` file and the `1CCM.pqr` file, 
the necessary commands are

```
mkdir results
cd results
../poisson_boltzmann 
```
 
To run in parallel with MPI, change the last line with

```
mpirun -np <number of processes> ../poisson_boltzmann
```

with `<number of processes>` equal to the desired number of processors. 

To select a different option file add the following option

```
--potfile /your/folder/<file name>.pot
```

While to change the input molecule add the following option

```
--pqrfile /your/folder/<file name>.pqr
```
Files .pqr must not contain the optional feature `CHAIN_ID`, because the code cannot read that column. For example, .pqr files created with PDB2PQR and the â€“whitespace option are guaranteed to conform to the correct format:

```
pdb2pqr --ff=charmm --whitespace 4ake.pdb 4ake.pqr
```

without the option `--keep-chain`. Otherwise, if the user utilizes online website to generate the file .pqr, it has to be sure to un-tick the option `add/keep chain IDs in the PQR file`.

### Post-processing of Output Files

The user can use the `GNU Octave` script called `export.m` and 
distributed with `bimpp` (it is located in the  folder `script/m`)
for the post-processing. When the user adopts the default names for the files, it 
can write the following command line for the creation of a .vtu file that can be 
opened using Paraview. 

```
   export_tmesh_data ('poisson_boltzmann_surface_%1.1d_%4.4d',
                       {'poisson_boltzmann_surface_%1.1d_%4.4d', 'phi_%1.1d_%4.4d', 
                       'rhs_%1.1d_%4.4d', 'rho_%1.1d_%4.4d'}, {'surface', 'phi', 'rhs', 'rho'},
                       {'poisson_boltzmann_marker_%1.1d_%4.4d', 'epsilon_%1.1d_%4.4d',
                       'reaction_%1.1d_%4.4d'}, {'marker', 'epsilon', 'reaction'},
                       'output_name', 0, processors_number)
```

where `output_name` can be substituted with an arbitrary name for the `.vtu ` file and `processors_number` 
must be replaced by the number of processors used for the simulation. 

The user can also decide to convert only some among the outputs according to his necessities. 

### Projects

Below an (unordered) list of improvement/fixes/new features that we expect to implement in the near future

1. Separate the effect of each residue on the energy
2. Account for the *Stern Layer* in the model
3. Singularity removal
4. Nonlinear ionic density
5. Coulombi boundary conditions + other choices for boundary conditions
6. Map of Electrostatic potential on triangulated molecular surface (*.offc* file format)
7. Allow more flexible format for *.pqr* files (in particular with or without ChainID column)
